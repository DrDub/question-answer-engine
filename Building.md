The main driver atm is skele.py. In order for the program to run you will need

  * regexp\_answer.py
  * skele.py
  * unigram\_tagger.bin
  * bigram\_tagger.bin
  * trigram\_tagger.bin

The bin files are platform specific so you must use gen\_taggers.py in order to generate your platforms specific tagger bins.
