# Introduction #

Before we dive head-first into this project, we need to know what is already out there. Over the past 2 weeks I've skimmed ~30 articles from the [ACL Anthology](http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/), the database of journals devoted to NLP. From these, I've made [a list of seven articles](http://code.google.com/p/pittcsqa/wiki/StronglyRelatedDocuments?updated=StronglyRelatedDocuments&ts=1202372893) that I think are important to read. Take a look and edit this page if you see something you like and would want to focus on.

> The first two articles, I think, are most beneficial. It explains that in order to have a completely functional program, we must combine multiple approaches. For the CMU project, we should split our group into three groups: two one-man teams of programmers each focusing on different approaches to the problem, and one two-person team to keep the programmers on-track. This project is not so much a programming project but a research project.
> So which two approaches do we take? Personally I like the statistical n-gram approach. Find a few keywords from the question and look for repeating n-grams from the answer text. This is developed in the third article, where the "noisy-channel approach" is just taking your n-grams and changing a word or two, and repeating the search.
